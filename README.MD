Vrax is a side scrolling shooter made by Mark Troyer for the Ludum Dare 40 compo. The entire game and assets were created over 48 hours from scratch.

It features 4 playable ships that you can transform between at will each with their own trade-offs.

Tools Used:
I used Visual Studio 2017 with .NET Core framework 2.0 and Nuget installed.
I used my own game engine called PSEngine which you can find the Nuget packages inside LocalNuget\ folder. To use it, just create a new local nuget package reference pointing to that folder and everything should build.
I used FLStudio 12 to make the music and sfxr for the sound effects.
I used Pyxel Edit and Paint.Net to make the sprites.
I used TexturePacker to package the sprites into atlas's.

I hope you enjoy the game! I'll have a recorded time-lapse uploaded later.
